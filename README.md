# PrivateEvents app

This is "Private Events" coding project in the The Odin Project Curriculum.\

## Description:
- The app is about creating new events and allowing other users to attend these events
- Any visitor can see upcoming events
- Only registered users can create and attend events
- Each event has only one creator, but can have many attendees
- Event creators can update and delete their events
- Event attendees can attend an event or choose not to attend anymore

The coding challenge can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events.\
The running app can be found here: https://privateevents.fly.dev/.

## My goals:
- Gain deeper understanding of associations, especially of 'has many - through'
- Improve querying, avoiding n+1 queries

## To do:
- Finish setting up devise
    - Remembering user
    - Adding password reset functionality
- Implement sending notices to attendees about upcoming events
- Implement "following" of event creators - user should get notified about new event
